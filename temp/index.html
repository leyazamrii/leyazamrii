    <p>Welcome to my personal blog! Here I share my stories and interests.</p>
    <p>My name is Nur Aleya Sofia Binti Zamri and I am a final year student of Diploma in Information Science at UiTM Merbok, Sungai Petani. This is my first time creating a personal website using HTML. I really hope you guys enjoy it!!</p>
    
    <h2>this month's proudest creation<3</h2>
    <p>This month has been all about learning, creating, and pushing myself to try something new and I‚Äôm proud to say that this personal website is the result of that journey. I‚Äôve spent the past few weeks exploring web design, writing about my interests, and figuring out how to express myself online in a fun and meaningful way. 
       Every section, from the hobbies I enjoy to the memories I cherish with my friends, reflects a part of who I am. Building this site from scratch felt challenging at times, but it‚Äôs also been incredibly rewarding. Seeing it all come together is a small but meaningful success that I‚Äôm truly proud of.
       I‚Äôve put my heart into every detail, and I hope you enjoy looking through my website as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to explore and get to know me better and if you‚Äôd like to see more of my daily life, thoughts, and little moments, you can also visit my social media! The link is below.</p>
